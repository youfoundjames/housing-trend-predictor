# housing-trend-predictor

We are using time-series data found on Kaggle on US housing trends to analyze correlations between average home values, average time on market, and average price cuts. The dataset contains the average home value by city by month from 2000-2024, and from 2018-2024 it includes monthly data about average time on market and price cuts. 

The dataset can be found here, or otherwise in the project file: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clovisdalmolinvieira/us-housing-trends-values-time-and-price-cuts
